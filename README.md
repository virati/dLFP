# Differential LFP Simulation Library
Author: Vineet Tiruvadi


## Overview
A new class of clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices is capable of both stimulation and recording. A growing strategy for this approach is to use differential recordings of local field potentials (LFP) to remove stimulation artifact and other common-mode artifacts. This strategy is effective but also sensitive to non-uniformity and dynamics in the surrounding brain. This library simulates a differential LFP recording device and identifies distortions that can be traced to impedance mismatches and amplifier gain compression.

## Installation

### Dependencies
Oscillatory analyses depend on a separate library called DBSpace, available here:

## Notebook
A provided notebook enables interactive adjustment of the stimulation parameters.
